% ABSTRACT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 \begin{abstract}
  We develop a emulator of halo statistics (halo mass function, halo
  auto-spectrum, and halo-matter cross correlation) that are given as a
  function of halo mass, redshift and cosmological model, carefully
  calibrated using a suite of $N$-body siulations assuming cold dark
  matter dominated structure formation scenario.

\section{Results}

\mtrv{The results should include halo mass function, halo auto-spectra,
 halo-matter cross-spectra, matter power spectrum, bias function $b(k)$,
 cross-correlation function $r(k)$, ... as a function of halo mass and
 redshift, and cosmological model.}
